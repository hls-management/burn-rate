# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add browser support to the Burn Rate strategy game, allowing players to play the game in a web browser while maintaining all existing gameplay functionality. The browser version should provide an equivalent gaming experience to the CLI version, with an intuitive web-based interface that preserves the fast-paced, strategic nature of the game.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play Burn Rate in my web browser, so that I can enjoy the game without needing to install Node.js or use a terminal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the game URL THEN the browser SHALL display a fully functional web version of Burn Rate
2. WHEN the game loads in the browser THEN the system SHALL initialize with the same game mechanics as the CLI version
3. WHEN a user interacts with the web interface THEN the system SHALL respond with the same game logic and AI behavior as the CLI version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want an intuitive web interface for game commands, so that I can easily build units, attack, and manage my strategy without memorizing text commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to build units THEN the interface SHALL provide clickable buttons or forms for unit construction
2. WHEN a user wants to attack THEN the interface SHALL provide an intuitive way to specify fleet composition and targets
3. WHEN a user wants to view game status THEN the interface SHALL display all relevant information in an organized, readable format
4. WHEN a user performs any game action THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the web version to maintain game state and handle errors gracefully, so that my gaming experience is smooth and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during gameplay THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages without crashing
2. WHEN the game state changes THEN the interface SHALL update automatically to reflect the current state
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL either preserve the game state or provide a clear way to start a new game
4. WHEN the AI takes its turn THEN the interface SHALL show the AI's actions and update the display accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the same game configuration options in the browser, so that I can customize my gaming experience like in the CLI version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new game THEN the system SHALL allow users to select AI archetype (aggressor, economist, trickster, hybrid)
2. WHEN starting a new game THEN the system SHALL allow users to set starting resources
3. WHEN starting a new game THEN the system SHALL allow users to enable debug mode
4. WHEN starting a new game THEN the system SHALL allow users to set a random seed for reproducible games

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the browser version to reuse existing game engine code, so that we maintain consistency and avoid duplicating game logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the browser version THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing GameEngine, GameController, and InputHandler classes
2. WHEN the browser version processes commands THEN it SHALL use the same command processing logic as the CLI version
3. WHEN the browser version handles game state THEN it SHALL use the same validation and error handling as the CLI version
4. WHEN the browser version runs AI turns THEN it SHALL use the same AI logic and behavior as the CLI version

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want responsive design and good performance in the browser, so that I can play on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads on different screen sizes THEN the interface SHALL adapt appropriately for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN the game runs in the browser THEN it SHALL maintain smooth performance during gameplay
3. WHEN displaying game information THEN the interface SHALL be readable and usable on various screen sizes
4. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL respond quickly without noticeable lag

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to easily switch between CLI and browser versions, so that I can choose my preferred way to play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN both CLI and browser versions SHALL be available
2. WHEN running the CLI version THEN it SHALL work exactly as before without any regression
3. WHEN accessing the browser version THEN it SHALL be clearly distinct from the CLI version
4. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL explain how to use both versions
