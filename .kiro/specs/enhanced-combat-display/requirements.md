# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the combat event display in the CLI interface by expanding the information shown and adding color coding to improve readability and user experience. Currently, combat events are displayed with basic text formatting, but players need more detailed and visually appealing combat information to better understand battle outcomes and make strategic decisions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see detailed combat information with color coding, so that I can quickly understand battle outcomes and casualties at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a combat event occurs THEN the system SHALL display expanded combat details including battle phases, tactical advantages, and detailed casualty breakdowns
2. WHEN displaying combat events THEN the system SHALL use color coding to distinguish between different types of information (victories, defeats, casualties, survivors)
3. WHEN showing attacker information THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors for player vs AI actions
4. WHEN displaying battle outcomes THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors (green for victories, red for defeats, yellow for close battles)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see enhanced visual formatting for combat events, so that important information stands out and is easier to read.

1. WHEN displaying fleet compositions THEN the system SHALL use color-coded unit types (frigates, cruisers, battleships)
2. WHEN showing casualties THEN the system SHALL highlight losses with appropriate warning colors
3. WHEN displaying survivors THEN the system SHALL use distinct formatting to show remaining forces
4. WHEN showing multiple combat events THEN the system SHALL use visual separators and consistent formatting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see tactical information in combat reports, so that I can understand why battles had specific outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a battle occurs THEN the system SHALL display tactical advantages based on unit composition effectiveness
2. WHEN showing battle phases THEN the system SHALL indicate which side had advantages in different combat phases
3. WHEN displaying outcomes THEN the system SHALL provide brief explanations for decisive vs close battles
4. WHEN multiple rounds occur THEN the system SHALL show the progression of the battle

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want combat events to be displayed immediately after turn processing, so that I can see the results of my actions and AI responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a turn ends THEN the system SHALL display all combat events that occurred during that turn
2. WHEN displaying turn results THEN the system SHALL show combat events before other turn summary information
3. WHEN no combat occurs THEN the system SHALL display a brief "No combat this turn" message
4. WHEN multiple combat events occur THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order
